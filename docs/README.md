### Release builds
Example Mod has relatively stable beta builds available for release for 1.20.2 on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/examplemod) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/examplemod). A full 1.0.0 release will be coming soon.

### Bleeding edge builds
If youâ€™re feeling a bit more adventurous or wish to help test the in-development versions, we provide **bleeding edge builds** which are produced on [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/The-Aether-Team/Example-Mod). These builds are created for every new commit and contain the latest available code. We do not recommend users treat these builds as releases, as they are unfinished and may contain serious issues. If you wish to download these builds, check out [this guide](https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/Example-Mod/wiki/CircleCI-Guide).

### Packages
To install this mod through GitHub Packages in Gradle for development, you will need the [Gradle Github Packages Plugin](https://github.com/0ffz/gpr-for-gradle). To use it, make sure you have access to the Gradle plugins maven and the plugin as a buildscript dependency:

<details>
<summary> Buildscript Code</summary>

`settings.gradle`
```
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}
```

`build.gradle`
```
plugins {
    id 'io.github.0ffz.github-packages' version '[1,2)'
}
```

</details>

Then you need to specify the package you want to use in your repository:

<details>
<summary> Repositories Code</summary>

```
repositories {
  ...
  maven githubPackage.invoke("The-Aether-Team/Example-Mod")
}
```

</details>

Then load it through your dependencies, with `project.examplemod_version` specified in the `gradle.properties`:

<details>
<summary> Dependencies Code</summary>

```
dependencies {
  ...
  implementation fg.deobf("com.example.examplemod:examplemod:${project.examplemod_version}")
  ...
}
```

</details>
